            <h2>Idaho Fly Fishing</h2>
            <p>
                Welcome! This simple site is a quick guide to fly fishing in eastern Idaho—home to legendary water like the Henry's Fork, South Fork of the Snake, and a constellation of alpine lakes. My goal is to nudge you outdoors to enjoy the quiet, the current, and the occasional electric tug of a trout. Use the links above to learn which fish are popular to the rivers and lakes near Rexburg, as well as to see a few of my favorite places and some of my catches.

            <h2>Why Fly Fishing</h2>
            <p>
                Fly fishing slows you down. You start to notice currents, hatches, shadows, and how wind touches the water. In eastern Idaho, that awareness comes with big skies, volcanic canyons, and clear, cold rivers shaped by snowmelt.

            <h2>Purpose of Site</h2>
            <p>
                This site focuses specifically on eastern Idaho water and fish. Conditions change with season and flow, but the sense of peace is always there. I've kept things simple as I am fairly new to the region/sport.
